# poketext

I am using text from Pokédex entries from main Pokémon games to practice text processing, web scraping, and using [spaCy](http://spacy.io) for NLP/NLU phenomena.

## Gratitude to:
* [`pokemon.json`](https://github.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json) for the excellent Pokémon dataset that I pulled names from.
